We want to build an AI Agent that can aid in Presentation making.
The GUI of this "app" has to be a chat interface (click a button to start a new chat).
The changes should happen "live", in the sense that asking the AI to make a change should dynamically update the PPT that is open currently.
The tools should be made using the pywin32 library with COM automation that allows full control over the presentation making.
The tools should includes things like CRUD operations for text boxes, shapes etc for the start (we will add more tools later).
The agentic framework that we aim to use is HuggingFace smolagents framework.
There should also be tools to have animation control over objects.
